Simple apriori and eclat models in python and R 

When we go grocery shopping, we often have a standard list of things to buy. Each shopper has a distinctive list, depending on oneâ€™s needs and preferences. A housewife might buy healthy ingredients for a family dinner, while a bachelor might buy beer and chips. Understanding these buying patterns can help to increase sales in several ways. If there is a pair of items, X and Y, that are frequently bought together:

* Both X and Y can be placed on the same shelf, so that buyers of one item would be prompted to buy the other.
* Promotional discounts could be applied to just one out of the two items.
* Advertisements on X could be targeted at buyers who purchase Y.
* X and Y could be combined into a new product, such as having Y in flavors of X.
